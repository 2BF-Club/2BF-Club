                "abstract": "T cells play a crucial role in the immune system by identifying and eliminating tumor cells. Malignant cancer cells can hijack mitochondria (MT) from nearby T cells, affecting their metabolism and weakening their immune functions. This phenomenon, observed through co-culture systems and fluorescent labeling, has been further explored with the development of the MERCI algorithm, which predicts T cell MT hijacking in cancer cells using single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing data. However, MERCI is limited by its reliance on a linear model and its inability to handle data sparsity. To address these challenges, we introduce MitoR, a computational algorithm using a Poisson–Gamma mixture model to predict T cell MT hijacking from tumor scRNA data. In performance comparisons, MitoR demonstrated improved performance compared to MERCI’s on gold-standard benchmark datasets scRNA-bench1 (top AUROC: 0.761, top accuracy: 0.769) and scRNA-bench2 (top AUROC: 0.730, top accuracy: 0.733). Additionally, MitoR showed an average 4.14% increase in AUROC and an average 3.86% increase in accuracy over MERCI in all rank strategies and simulated datasets. Finally, MitoR revealed T cell MT hijacking events in two real-world tumor datasets (basal cell carcinoma and esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma), highlighting their role in tumor immune evasion."

                "abstract": "Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology has grown rapidly to track real-time blood glucose levels and trends with improved sensor accuracy. The ease of use and wide availability of CGM will facilitate safe and effective decision making for diabetes management. Here, we developed an attention-based deep learning model, CGMformer, pretrained on a well-controlled and diverse corpus of CGM data to represent individual's intrinsic metabolic state and enable clinical applications. During pretraining, CGMformer encodes glucose dynamics including glucose level, fluctuation, hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia into latent space with self-supervised learning. It shows generalizability in imputing glucose value across five external datasets with different populations and metabolic states (MAE = 3.7 mg/dL). We then fine-tuned CGMformer towards a diverse panel of downstream tasks in the screening of diabetes and its complications using task-specific data, which demonstrated a consistently boosted predictive accuracy over direct fine-tuning on a single task (AUROC = 0.914 for type 2 diabetes (T2D) screening and 0.741 for complication screening). By learning an intrinsic representation of an individual's glucose dynamics, CGMformer classifies non-diabetic individuals into six clusters with elevated T2D risks, and identifies a specific cluster with lean body-shape but high risk of glucose metabolism disorders, which is overlooked by traditional glucose measurements. Furthermore, CGMformer achieves high accuracy in predicting an individual's postprandial glucose response with dietary modelling (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.763) and helps personalized dietary recommendations. Overall, CGMformer pretrains a transformer neural network architecture to learn an intrinsic representation by borrowing information from a large amount of daily glucose profiles, and demonstrates predictive capabilities fine-tuned towards a broad range of downstream applications, holding promise for the early warning of T2D and recommendations for lifestyle modification in diabetes management."

Whether there exist the Genes Steadily Associated with Prognosis (GEARs) and what their functions are remain largely elusive. We have developed a novel method called “Multi-gradient Permutation Survival Analysis” (MEMORY) to screen the GEARs using RNA-seq data from the TCGA database. Then we employed a network construction approach to identify hub genes from GEARs, and utilized them for cancer classification. In the case of LUAD, the GEARs were found to be related to mitosis. Our analysis suggested that LUAD cell lines carrying PIK3CA mutations exhibit increased drug resistance. For BRCA, the GEARs were related to immunity. The analysis revealed that CDH1 mutation might influence immune infiltration through the EMT process in BRCA. We further explored the prognostic relevance of mitosis and immunity through their respective scores. This study offers significant biological insights into GEARs and highlights their potential as robust prognostic indicators across diverse cancer types."

Presently, most methods for inferring gene regulatory and biological networks rely on association studies or observational causal-analysis approaches. This study introduces a novel approach that combines intervention operations and diffusion models within a do-calculus framework by deep learning, i.e., Causal Diffusion Do-calculus (CDD) analysis, to infer causal networks between molecules. CDD can extract causal relations from observed data owing to its intervention operations, thereby significantly enhancing the accuracy and generalizability of causal network inference. Computationally, CDD has been applied to both simulated data and real omics data, which demonstrates that CDD outperforms existing methods in accurately inferring gene regulatory networks and identifying causal links from genes to disease phenotypes. Especially, compared with the Mendelian randomization algorithm and other existing methods, the CDD can reliably identify the disease genes or molecules for complex diseases with better performances. In addition, the causal analysis between various diseases and the potential factors in different populations from the UK Biobank database is also conducted, which further validated the effectiveness of CDD."

                "abstract": "Inferring causal links or subgraphs corresponding to a specific phenotype or label based solely on measured data is an important yet challenging task, which is also different from inferring causal nodes. While Graph Neural Network (GNN) Explainers have shown potential in subgraph identification, existing methods with GNN often offer associative rather than causal insights. This lack of transparency and explainability hinders our understanding of their results and also underlying mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a novel method of causal link/subgraph inference, called CIDER: Counterfactual-Invariant Diffusion-based GNN ExplaineR, by implementing both counterfactual and diffusion implementations. In other words, it is a model-agnostic and task-agnostic framework for generating causal explanations based on a counterfactual-invariant and diffusion process, which provides not only causal subgraphs due to counterfactual implementation but reliable causal links due to the diffusion process. Specifically, CIDER is first formulated as an inference task that generatively provides the two distributions of one causal subgraph and another spurious subgraph. Then, to enhance the reliability, we further model the CIDER framework as a diffusion process. Thus, using the causal subgraph distribution, we can explicitly quantify the contribution of each subgraph to a phenotype/label in a counterfactual manner, representing each subgraph's causal strength. From a causality perspective, CIDER is an interventional causal method, different from traditional association studies or observational causal approaches, and can also reduce the effects of unobserved confounders. We evaluate CIDER on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which all demonstrate the superiority of CIDER over state-of-the-art methods."

Identifying these critical states or tipping points is crucial for understanding disease progression and developing effective interventions. To address this challenge, we have developed a model-free method named Network Information Entropy of Edges (NIEE). Leveraging dynamic network biomarkers, sample-specific networks, and information entropy theories, NIEE can detect critical states or tipping points in diverse data types, including bulk, single-sample expression data. By applying NIEE to real disease datasets, we successfully identified critical predisease stages and tipping points before disease onset. Our findings underscore NIEE’s potential to enhance comprehension of complex disease development."

However, a molecular and cellular profile of sex differences and their modulation by androgens is still lacking. Here we constructed a high-dimensional single-cell transcriptomic atlas comprising over 2.3 million cells from 17 tissues in Mus musculus and explored the effects of sex and androgens on the molecular programs and cellular populations. In particular, we found that sex-biased immune gene expression and immune cell populations, such as group 2 innate lymphoid cells, were modulated by androgens. Integration with the UK Biobank dataset revealed potential cellular targets and risk gene enrichment in antigen presentation for sex-biased diseases. This study lays the groundwork for understanding the sex differences orchestrated by androgens and provides important evidence for targeting the androgen pathway as a broad therapeutic strategy for sex-biased diseases."

Although surrogate gradient-based methods offer a workable solution, trained SNNs frequently fall into local minima because they are still primarily based on gradient dynamics. Inspired by the chaotic dynamics in animal brain learning, we propose a chaotic spiking backpropagation (CSBP) method that introduces a loss function to generate brain-like chaotic dynamics and further takes advantage of the ergodic and pseudo-random nature to make SNN learning effective and robust. From a computational viewpoint, we found that CSBP significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on both neuromorphic data sets (e.g. DVS-CIFAR10 and DVS-Gesture) and large-scale static data sets (e.g. CIFAR100 and ImageNet) in terms of accuracy and robustness. From a theoretical viewpoint, we show that the learning process of CSBP is initially chaotic, then subject to various bifurcations and eventually converges to gradient dynamics, consistently with the observation of animal brain activity. Our work provides a superior core tool for direct SNN training and offers new insights into understanding the learning process of a biological brain."

In this study, based on spatiotemporal information (STI) transformation for high-dimensional real-time data, we developed a model-free framework, i.e., real-time spatiotemporal information transformation learning (RSIT), for extending the nonlinear and nonstationary time series. Specifically, by transforming high-dimensional information of the global navigation satellite system into one-dimensional dynamics via the STI strategy, RSIT efficiently utilizes two criteria of the transformed one-dimensional dynamics, i.e., unpredictability and instability. Such two criteria contemporaneously signal a potential critical transition of the geodynamical system, thereby providing early-warning signals of possible upcoming earthquakes. RSIT explores both the spatial and temporal dynamics of real-world data on the basis of a solid theoretical background in nonlinear dynamics and delay-embedding theory. The effectiveness of RSIT was demonstrated on geodynamical data of recent earthquakes from a number of regions across at least 4 y and through further comparison with existing methods."

Studies in recent years have shown that eccDNA is often enriched during tumors and aging, and participates in the development of cell physiological activities in a special way, so people have paid more and more attention to the eccDNA, and it has also become a critical new topic in modern biological research. Description We built a database to collect eccDNA, including animals, plants and fungi, and provide researchers with an eccDNA retrieval platform. The collected eccDNAs were processed in a uniform format and classified according to the species to which it belongs and the chromosome of the source. Each eccDNA record contained sequence length, start and end sites on the corresponding chromosome, order of the bases, genomic elements such as genes and transposons, and other information in the respective sequencing experiment. All the data were stored into the TeCD (The eccDNA Collection Database) and the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) sequence alignment function was also added into the database for analyzing the potential eccDNA sequences. Conclusion We built TeCD, a platform for users to search and obtain eccDNA data, and analyzed the possible potential functions of eccDNA. These findings may provide a basis and direction for researchers to further explore the biological significance of eccDNA in the future."

Specifically, stMVC adopting semi-supervised graph attention autoencoder separately learns view-specific representations of histological-similarity-graph or spatial-location-graph, and then simultaneously integrates two-view graphs for robust representations through attention under semi-supervision of biological contexts. stMVC outperforms other tools in detecting tissue structure, inferring trajectory relationships, and denoising on benchmark slices of human cortex. Particularly, stMVC identifies disease-related cell-states and their transition cell-states in breast cancer study, which are further validated by the functional and survival analysis of independent clinical data. Those results demonstrate clinical and prognostic applications from SRT data."
